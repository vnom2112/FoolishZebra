Capstone project for BYU Big Data

I did not commit any DHCP or Web Log data for NDA reasons.
You will need to copy and paste some of the data into the text files to run the example programs.

Please be mindful of the things committed to GitHub, we do not want to inadvertently break the NDA
agreement or share sensitive data.
